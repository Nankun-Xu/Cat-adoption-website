            <p>The KK Cat's cage-free environment provides previously homeless adult cats a place to wander and play. Given a chance for their authentic kitty natures to emerge, they can find wonderful forever homes, and leave the shelter behind.</p>
            <AccordionSection title="WHAT TO EXPECT">
                <p className="accordian__text">A visit to The KK Cat may range from active and playful to cozy and quiet. If cats are snoozing, simply relax and enjoy their calming presence. If the cats are awake, you are invited to socialize, play, and join in their fun. If there are fewer than ten cats in the room when you visit,
                    it's because some have been adopted â€” a happy event! We bring new cats in to The KK Cat on the days that we're closed to the public in order to give them a chance to adjust to their new surroundings.
                    Some guests come exclusively to spend time with cats, while others bring their laptops, books or sketchpads and spend their hour working. If you're looking to interact with cats, you'll find many toys and treats to interest some of our feline residents.
                    From time to time, the KK Cat hosts events such as Purr Yoga, craft workshops, and music nights. Tickets for those events will be made available when the event is scheduled.  </p>
