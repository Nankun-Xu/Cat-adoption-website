                    <p>You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a KK Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many KK services when you're signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on KK or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like Chrome Incognito mode. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control what we collect and how your information is used.
                        To help explain things as clearly as possible, we've added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for key terms. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us.</p>
                    <p>Some of our sites create a “cookie,” a record within your web browser, which makes it possible for our sites to recognize that a specific device has made previous requests. Doing so facilitates your future access to the site.</p>
